Its build process is manageable, and its importance in the research community makes it a meaningful subject for packaging experiments.</p> <p>SAOImageDS9 is an astronomical imaging and data visualization application developed by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. It is widely used in the astrophysics community for displaying and analyzing FITS files.</p> <p>The application is written in C and uses Tcl/Tk for its graphical user interface. Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a scripting language, and Tk is its GUI toolkit. This makes DS9 somewhat atypical compared to modern applications, but also relatively self-contained.</p> <p>The software is relatively straightforward to compile on Unix-like systems, with few external dependencies and a traditional <code>configure &amp;&amp; make</code> build process.</p>"},{"location":"flatpak/","title":"Flatpak","text":"<p>\ud83d\udea7 This page is currently under construction \ud83d\udea7</p> <p>In the meantime, feel free to explore the recipe on GitHub:</p> <p>https://github.com/epassaro/ds9-flatpak</p>"}]}
